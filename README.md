# Spend Sats in Australia

SatsSpend is a list of Australian businesses that accept bitcoin. The aim of SatsSpend is to encourage a circular economy in which Aussie bitcoiners can more easily spend their sats with bitcoin businesses (and so bitcoin businesses get the support they deserve). 

This list is **not** intended for bitcoin exchanges or third-party payment processors (e.g., to get paid in bitcoin or pay bills in bitcoin). There are already numerous lists of such intermediate businesses.

### Tax Guidance
To spend bitcoin in Australia without incurring a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event, you would ideally buy and spend your sats in line with the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investments-and-assets/Crypto-asset-investments/Crypto-as-a-personal-use-asset/" target="blank">Australian Tax Office's personal use asset guidance</a>.

For more comprehensive information on the ATO's tax treatment of spending (i.e., "disposing of") bitcoin, see the ATO guide titled <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investments-and-assets/Crypto-asset-investments/Transactions---acquiring-and-disposing-of-crypto-assets/" target="blank">Transactions – acquiring and disposing of crypto assets</a>.
