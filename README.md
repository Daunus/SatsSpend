# Spend Sats in Australia

SatsSpend a list of Australian businesses that accept bitcoin. The aim is to establish and encourage a circular economy in which Aussie bitcoiners can more easily spend their sats with bitcoin businesses (and so bitcoin businesses get the support they deserve!). 

This list is **not** intended for bitcoin exchanges or third-party payment processors (e.g., to get paid in bitcoin or pay bills in bitcoin). There are already numerous lists of such intermediate businesses.

### Tax Guidance
To spend bitcoin in Australia without incurring a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event, you would ideally buy and spend your sats in line with the Australian Tax Office's <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/general/gen/tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-australia---specifically-bitcoin/?page=2#Personal_use_asset">personal use asset guidance</a>. 

For more comprehensive information on the ATO's tax treatment of spending (i.e., "disposing of") bitcoin, see the ATO guide titled <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Gen/Tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-Australia---specifically-bitcoin/?anchor=Transactingwithcryptocurrency">Transacting with cryptocurrency</a> and the ATO fact sheet titled <a href="https://iorder.com.au/publication/Download.aspx?ProdID=75362-09.2021">Tax smart tips for your cryptocurrency (ID: 75362-09.2021)</a>.
